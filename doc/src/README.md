# Introduction

Schlandals is a state-of-the-art _Projected Weighted Model Counter_ specialized for probabilistic inference over discrete probability distributions.
Currently, there are known modelization for the following problems
  - Computing the marginal probabilities of a variable in a Bayesian Network
  - Computing the probability that two nodes are connected in a probabilistic graph
  - Computing the probability of [ProbLog](https://github.com/ML-KULeuven/problog) programs

For more information on how to use Schlandals and its mechanics, check [the documentation](https://aia-uclouvain.github.io/schlandals/doc).
